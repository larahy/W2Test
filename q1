Explain what git clone does in your own words.

Git clone is an instruction to make a copy of either a local repository, or a repository on github so you can work on the code. 

If you are cloning local repositorys you must move to the parent directory of that repository and use the following structure:

git clone <repo you are cloning> <name of new repo>

If you are cloning from github you move to the directory where you would like to clone the repo and use the following structure 

git clone <SSH key provided on github>
