Explain what the upstream remote is usually used for, in your own words.

An upstream remote is used for pushing changes to another repo.  You can set up an upstream remote to other local repositories, or to repositories on github - your own, or otherwise.

Remotes are added by writing:

git remote add origin <ssh key> -- if the repo is in github and you have write access.

git remote add shared <reponame> -- if the repo is local and you have write access.
