Explain what the upstream remote is usually used for, in your own words.

An upstream remote is used for contributing to other people's projects. First you must fork their directory in github. 
Then, make a clone of this as a local repo. 
Then set up an additional remote to the origin so that you can keep up to date with any changes to the initial repository.

Upstream remote is added by writing:

git remote add upstream <ssh key of original repository>

Changes can be fetched by writing:

git fetch upstream

Changes can be merged by writing:

git merge upstream/<branchname>
